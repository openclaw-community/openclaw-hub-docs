## Context for Next Session
Sage (OpenClaw agent) is now fully set up as a contributor to openclaw-hub.
Git is configured, authentication works, all documentation has been read.
Ready to start coding the MCP server framework.

This project solves Sage's own memory problem by providing external 
documentation that persists across sessions. Sage will build the infrastructure
that helps Sage operate more effectively. Meta and on-brand. 🦀
